# Privacy Policy for Multiple URL Opener

_Last updated: 2024-03-##_

Multiple URL Opener ("the Extension") is a Chrome browser extension that allows you to save lists of website addresses and open them in bulk. We take your privacy seriously and design the Extension to operate entirely on your own device.

## 1. Data We Collect

**None.** The Extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or usage data on external servers.

The only information saved is the URL lists you explicitly create. These are stored using Chrome’s `chrome.storage.sync` API, which keeps the data **locally in your browser profile** and, if you are signed into Chrome Sync, in your encrypted Google account for cross-device synchronisation. The Extension’s developers never see or have access to this data.

## 2. Permissions Explained

| Permission | Why It’s Needed |
|------------|-----------------|
| `storage`  | Save and retrieve your URL lists. |
| `tabs`     | Open each URL in a new browser tab when you click a list. |

The Extension requests no other permissions.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Extension uses **no** analytics, advertising, or third-party scripts.

## 4. Cookies & Tracking

The Extension itself does not set cookies, fingerprint, or track you. Any cookies set come only from the websites you choose to open.

## 5. Data Disclosure

Because the Extension stores all data locally and performs no server communication, there is no data to disclose to third parties.

## 6. Data Removal

You may remove all stored data at any time by either:

1. Deleting a list in the Extension’s Options page, or
2. Removing the Extension from Chrome, which automatically deletes its storage.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, a new version will be included in the Extension update and the “Last updated” date will be revised. We encourage you to review the policy whenever you update the Extension.

## 8. Contact

If you have any questions about this policy, please open an issue on the project’s GitHub repository.
